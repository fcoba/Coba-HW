# Coba-HW
This is my first homework assignment in Excel. 

This is how I submitted my homework:

First, I moved to my Desktop.

cd ~/Desktop/

Then, I made a douplicate GitHub repository on my Desktop. 

git clone https://github.com/fcoba/Coba-HW.git

Then, I moved my Excel HW on my Desktop to my repository folder. 

mv Coba_HW_1.xlsx Coba-HW/.

Next, I made sure I added my hw to Github. 

git add Coba_HW_1.xlsx 

Next, I made sure Github got the file on their end.  

git commit -m "HW 1 Submission"

This should have pushed my file from my desktop into the Github.
